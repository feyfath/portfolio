                <p>The personality is the typical pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaviors that make 
                    a person unique.

                    interesting and pleasant to be with. ...

                It's not about winning or losing a competition. 
                It's about beating the doubt within yourself and knowing that each day you are one step closer to your goals.
